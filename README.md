Codiad-CoffeeScriptCompiler
===========================

CoffeeScript compiler plugin for Codiad-IDE

This plugin compiles the current CoffeeScript file on each save and gives you some 
hints if the file could not be saved due to compilation issues.
See http://coffeescript.org/ for the CoffeeScript compiler.

Also integrates coffeelint to inform the user about bad pieces of code.
See http://www.coffeelint.org/ for details of coffeelint.

Compilation and Linting is completely done in the browser, so there are no further dependencies.

Installation
============

	Download the zip file and extract it to your plugins folder


Update 2014/01/12:
==================

I just translated the developed javascript code to CoffeeScript.
We are talking about a CoffeeScript compiler integration here, 
so it's useful to provide the sourcecode of this plugin also written in CoffeeScript. ;-)
