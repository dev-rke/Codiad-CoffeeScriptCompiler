Codiad-CoffeeScriptCompiler
===========================

CoffeeScript compiler plugin for Codiad-IDE

This plugin compiles the current coffeescript file on each save and gives you some 
hints if the file could not be saved due to compilation issues.

Installation
============

	Download the zip file and extract it to your plugins folder


Update 2014/01/12:
==================

I just translated the developed javascript code to coffeescript.
We are talking about a coffeescript compiler integration here, 
so it's useful to provide the sourcecode of this plugin also written in coffeescript. ;-)
